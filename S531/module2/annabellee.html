    <h1>Annabel Lee</h1>
    <h2>BY EDGAR ALLAN POE</h2>
    <p>It was many and many a year ago,<br>
       In a kingdom by the sea,<br>
       That a maiden there lived whom you may know<br>
       By the name of Annabel Lee;<br>
       And this maiden she lived with no other thought<br>
       Than to love and be loved by me.</p>

    <p>I was a child and she was a child,<br>
       In this kingdom by the sea,<br>
       But we loved with a love that was more than love—<br>
       I and my Annabel Lee—<br>
       With a love that the wingèd seraphs of Heaven<br>
       Coveted her and me.</p>

    <p>And this was the reason that, long ago,<br>
       In this kingdom by the sea,<br>
       A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling<br>
       My beautiful Annabel Lee;<br>
       So that her highborn kinsmen came<br>
       And bore her away from me,<br>
       To shut her up in a sepulchre<br>
       In this kingdom by the sea.</p>

    <p>The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,<br>
       Went envying her and me—<br>
       Yes!—that was the reason (as all men know,<br>
       In this kingdom by the sea)<br>
       That the wind came out of the cloud by night,<br>
       Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.</p>

    <p>But our love it was stronger by far than the love<br>
       Of those who were older than we—<br>
       Of many far wiser than we—<br>
       And neither the angels in Heaven above<br>
       Nor the demons down under the sea<br>
       Can ever dissever my soul from the soul<br>
       Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;</p>

    <p>For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams<br>
       Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;<br>
       And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes<br>
       Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;<br>
       And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side<br>
       Of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride,<br>
       In her sepulchre there by the sea—<br>
       In her tomb by the sounding sea.</p>
